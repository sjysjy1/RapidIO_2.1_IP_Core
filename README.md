# RapidIO_2.1_IP_Core
This repository is an ISE project file which contains an implementation of a RapidIO 2.1 IP(Intellectual Property) core with Verilog HDL. It's a serial $1\times$ and $4\times$ RTL level IP core of RapidIO 2.1. It supports operations of messaging, read/write for 8b/10b encoded packets. <br>
And the testing code is also included, which is based on a KC705 evaluation board. To test the function of the designed IP core, it's tested to communicate with the commercial IP core of Xilinx. It's set as a master or slave to read and write packages from the commercial IP core.
